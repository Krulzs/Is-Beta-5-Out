    "content": "<p>It's widely expected within the community the Beta 5 of <em>Pokémon Unbreakable Ties</em>, but what exactly will it bring? While the progress bars offer an overall idea, this post aims to consolidate everything we know so far about the upcoming update.</p><p><em>⚠️ Spoiler Alert:</em> This post includes major story spoilers. We strongly discourage reading further if you haven't completed Beta 4.</p><p><strong>Beta 5 will introduce two major story arcs: the Southern Isles and the Past Arc.</strong></p><p>The <strong>Southern Isles</strong> arc centers on Darek and Eda during their 'vacation'. In Beta 4.5 (Farm Update), we learned that this region is home to the <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1931108790125936731' target='_blank'>Lunaris</a>, guardians of the land and its secrets. Their leader, <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1894536095133520105' target='_blank'>Lykos</a>, may become an <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1894536095133520105' target='_blank'>ally</a> after a boss fight with <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1898516423091052994' target='_blank'>Kleavor</a>, which likely follows a scene where <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1897407458064392241' target='_blank'>Sceptile intervenes</a> to rescue what appears to be a Lunaris being attacked.</p><p>Lykos will also provide lore about the <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1901054655628476797' target='_blank'>Celestia people</a> and present us to a new Mega Evolution: <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1928933254490382462' target='_blank'>Mega Mightyena</a>. This form comes with two new moves:</p><ul><li><strong>Night Howl:</strong> Dark-type Special Move (70 Power), lowers the target’s Attack and Sp. Atk.</li><li><strong>Silver Blitz:</strong> Fire-type Physical Move (100 Power), heals part of the inflicted damage, may burn. Only usable in Mega form.</li></ul><p>This region is deeply connected to <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1918062596189573342' target='_blank'>Latios and Latias</a>, and will develop the story of another couple: <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1919149806078820358' target='_blank'><em>Darek and Eda’s romance</em></a>.</p><p>You'll also encounter the <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1885833097851056411' target='_blank'>Tapus</a> (including a boss fight with <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1881484256729518372' target='_blank'>Tapu Koko</a>), who may have a significant role in the arc. Dr. Vega also plays a part in this region's narrative, plotting to summon <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1945605020763799769' target='_blank'>Deoxys</a> using a massive <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1862271929224188368' target='_blank'>meteor</a>, supposedly to control it and benefit the Royal Family. The Southern Isles promises to be a tragic and essential turning point.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, only Darek and Eda will be playable here. The protagonist will either remain on the Farm or appear in the Past Arc. There is no timeline confirmation for when these events take place in-game.</p><p>In response to feedback, Ssamurai confirmed on Discord that Darek and Eda’s Pokémon will have full EV spreads to ease gameplay. He also mentioned <a href='https://www.patreon.com/posts/shadow-pokemon-134194300?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link' target='_blank'>Shadow Pokémon</a>, which are expected to appear on the Isles and may be stronger — and possibly catchable?</p><p><strong>The Past Arc</strong> begins from the quest given by Majime at the end of Beta 4, involving a mission to retrieve a rare medicine from the now-destroyed Redwing — obliterated by Rayquaza, under Royal Family influence. (Source: In-game dialogue)</p><p>The time-travel method remains unknown, though fans suspect the Shrine in the Forest of Time may be key.

  "id": "summer-update",
  "title": "Summer Event Coming Soon",
  "content": "<p>We've got some exciting news about an upcoming version of the game, set to drop before Beta 5 around the end of August. Here's a rundown of everything Ssamurai shared about this update, why it's happening, and what you can expect.</p><h3>Why This Update?</h3><p>On August 2, Ssamurai hosted a stream to discuss a recent Discord post about new Summer Skins, currently exclusive to Patreon members but planned for everyone eventually. During the stream, Ssamurai clarified that this update is not Beta 5 and won't include Southern Isles content. Southern Isles is taking longer than anticipated due to added features and details enhancing the game's ambiance, gameplay, and story. Ssamurai emphasized that Southern Isles will only release alongside the Past Arc, not as a standalone.</p><p>Additionally, Ssamurai discussed transitioning Unbreakable Ties to Essentials v21.1, as mentioned in the Moves post on a previous DittoNews post. This transition is likely for Beta 5, which could delay releases by a few months. To keep players engaged during this gap, Ssamurai is rolling out this smaller update with fresh content.</p><h3>What's in the New Version?</h3><p>The character sprite reworks are exclusive to Beta 5 and won't appear in this update. Instead, this version introduces a new beach-themed event, hinted at in a previous Twitter post by Ssamurai. The event includes four new minigames:</p><ul><li>Rodolfo's Hide'n'Seek</li><li>Sakura's Rhythm Game (similar to Osu! Mania)</li><li>Bijou's Mining Game</li><li>Celeste's Surfing Game</li></ul><p>These minigames reward points that can be spent in an exclusive shop with items unavailable elsewhere in the game. Ssamurai also mentioned the possibility of summer-themed sprites for these characters (Source: Ssamurai98 stream, August 2).</p><h3>Difficulty Fixes and Updates</h3><p>The update addresses a bug in the difficulty system. Currently, Hard Mode and Radical Mode only increase enemy Pokémon levels, but they should also grant full 31 IVs (Hard Mode) and full EV distribution (Radical Mode). Due to a missing function call, these effects weren’t applied. The fix ensures:</p><ul><li>Hard Mode: Enemies have full 31 IVs.</li><li>Radical Mode: Enemies also have 252 EVs in their two highest stats and 6 EVs in the third (updated from the previous 85 EVs across all stats).</li></ul><p>The difficulty system has also been restructured. Previously, Radical Mode included Nuzlocke and Lucariolocke. Now, the difficulties are Easy, Normal, Hard, and Radical, with three optional challenge modes:</p><ul><li>Nuzlocke Mode</li><li>Randomlocke Mode</li><li>Lucariolocke Mode</li></ul><p>Players can combine these challenges for a tougher experience, but Randomlocke Mode won’t be available in this update. These challenges tie into a new Points System, rewarding players for actions like defeating trainers, catching new Pokémon species, and completing quests. You can also lose points, though details are still under wraps, and it’s unclear if this system will be in the upcoming version.</p><h3>Major Additions: Gen 9 Moves, Abilities, and Hisuian Forms</h3><p>This update brings a massive addition of Generation 9 content, including moves (excluding Terastal-related ones) and the following abilities:</p><ul><li>Good as Gold</li><li>Toxic Chain</li><li>Toxic Debris</li><li>Mind's Eye</li><li>Armor Tail</li><li>Guard Dog</li><li>Supreme Overlord</li><li>Well-Baked Body</li><li>All Treasures of Ruin abilities</li><li>Protosynthesis</li><li>Quark Drive</li><li>Tatsugiri’s Commander ability</li></ul><p>These abilities are implemented for their respective Pokémon.</p><p>Hisuian Forms are added as alternate evolutions with the following requirements:</p><ul><li>Typhlosion: Use a Fire Stone on a Quilava (level 36+, cancel normal evolution).</li><li>Samurott: Use a Water Stone on a Dewott (level 36+, cancel normal evolution).</li><li>Decidueye: Use a Leaf Stone on a Dartrix (level 34+, cancel normal evolution).</li><li>Ursaluna Bloodmoon: Use a Dusk Stone on Ursaring.</li><li>Lilligant: Use a Shiny Stone on Petilil.</li><li>Braviary: Use a Dawn Stone on a Rufflet (level 54+, cancel normal evolution).</li><li>Sliggoo and Goodra: Use a Water Stone on a Goomy (level 40+, cancel normal evolution).</li><li>Avalugg: Use an Ice Stone on a Bergmite (level 37+, cancel normal evolution).</li></ul><p>All Pokémon learnsets have been remastered using PokéAPI, combining moves from every generation. Note that some Generation 9 moves may be missing from certain movesets due to PokéAPI limitations.</p><h3>Closing Thoughts</h3><p>That’s everything confirmed for the upcoming version so far, based on Ssamurai’s stream and posts. Stay tuned for more updates, and get ready for some summer fun with the new event and minigames!</p><br><br><h1><em>SUMMER BIJOU</em></h1>"

    "title": "Generation 9 Moves Now in Unbreakable Ties",
    "content": "<p>Recently, <strong>Ssamurai</strong> posted on Twitter about one of the most highly requested features regarding battles in <em>Pokémon Unbreakable Ties</em>: <strong>Generation 9</strong> support.</p><p>Gen 9 brings a wide range of exciting additions, from beloved Pokémon like the powerful Paradox forms and Ogerpon, to already available legendaries like the Swords of Ruin. But what exactly was added — and what’s still missing?</p><p>This post takes a closer look at the new features, what was implemented, and what is planned for the near future.</p><h3>✅ What Was Added?</h3><p>The current update focuses on implementing <strong>moves</strong>. Since Unbreakable Ties runs on <strong>Pokémon Essentials v19.1</strong>, which had no Gen 9 plugin and even issues with Gen 8 moves, the update tackled both at once.</p><p><strong>All Gen 9 moves</strong> (except <em>Tera Blast</em> and <em>Tera Starstorm</em>) have been added, alongside hotfixes for previously bugged Gen 8 moves.</p><p>To make this possible, these specific things were implemented:</p><ul><li><strong>Commander</strong> ability (for <em>Order Up</em>)</li><li>Support for <strong>Ogerpon’s forms and masks</strong> (for <em>Ivy Cudgel</em>)</li><li>Support for <strong>Paldean Tauros</strong> forms (for <em>Raging Bull</em>)</li></ul><p>At this time, the only Gen 9 abilities coded in are: <strong>Sharpness</strong>, <strong>Purifying Salt</strong>, and <strong>Commander</strong>.</p><h3>🛠️ What’s Planned for the Future?</h3><p>The plan is to review all Gen 9 Pokémon and implement existing abilities from previous generations, such as <em>Moxie</em> for Quaquaval.</p><p>While not all Gen 9 abilities will be available in the <em>first</em> release of Beta 5, the following abilities are confirmed to be added:</p><ul><li><strong>Swords of Ruin</strong></li><li><strong>Paradox Pokémon</strong></li><li><strong>Gholdengo</strong></li></ul><p>This should ensure that most Gen 9 Pokémon are covered to some extent.</p><h3>🤔 Why Not Add Full Gen 9 Now?</h3><p>As mentioned, Unbreakable Ties is currently developed on <strong>Essentials v19.1</strong>, which — in simple terms — is pretty rough.</p><p>Do you remember <strong>Route 17</strong>? The rainy one? That’s why. Large, detailed maps on this version cause severe FPS drops, especially since Essentials v19.1 ties its FPS to the total number of animated frames on-screen.</p><p>There is a possibility of eventually moving development to <strong>Essentials v21.1</strong>. This shift would bring:</p><ul><li>Uncapped FPS (based on your monitor)</li><li>Built-in <strong>V-Sync</strong> to prevent screen tearing</li><li>Massive performance improvements</li><li>A completely recoded <strong>AI system</strong> — with smarter switching, better move choice logic, and less randomness</li><li>A new <strong>Ace System</strong>, ensuring enemy Aces appear last in tough fights</li><li>Improved translation tools for multilingual support</li></ul><br><h3>🔄 What Does That Mean for Gen 9?</h3><p>Switching to a newer version would allow using pre-built Gen 9 plugins. However, it would also mean all current Gen 9 coding efforts (done on v19.1) would be <strong>obsolete</strong>.</p><p>Because of this, the update might by aiming on only implementing critical Gen 9 content for now. If the version update happens, full integration would be possible — and worth the wait.</p><p>For now, we’ll have to wait and see what else Beta 5 will bring us!</p>"
