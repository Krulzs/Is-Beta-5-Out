    "content": "<p>It's widely expected within the community the Beta 5 of <em>Pokémon Unbreakable Ties</em>, but what exactly will it bring? While the progress bars offer an overall idea, this post aims to consolidate everything we know so far about the upcoming update.</p><p><em>⚠️ Spoiler Alert:</em> This post includes major story spoilers. We strongly discourage reading further if you haven't completed Beta 4.</p><p><strong>Beta 5 will introduce two major story arcs: the Southern Isles and the Past Arc.</strong></p><p>The <strong>Southern Isles</strong> arc centers on Darek and Eda during their 'vacation'. In Beta 4.5 (Farm Update), we learned that this region is home to the <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1931108790125936731' target='_blank'>Lunaris</a>, guardians of the land and its secrets. Their leader, <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1894536095133520105' target='_blank'>Lykos</a>, may become an <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1894536095133520105' target='_blank'>ally</a> after a boss fight with <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1898516423091052994' target='_blank'>Kleavor</a>, which likely follows a scene where <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1897407458064392241' target='_blank'>Sceptile intervenes</a> to rescue what appears to be a Lunaris being attacked.</p><p>Lykos will also provide lore about the <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1901054655628476797' target='_blank'>Celestia people</a> and present us to a new Mega Evolution: <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1928933254490382462' target='_blank'>Mega Mightyena</a>. This form comes with two new moves:</p><ul><li><strong>Night Howl:</strong> Dark-type Special Move (70 Power), lowers the target’s Attack and Sp. Atk.</li><li><strong>Silver Blitz:</strong> Fire-type Physical Move (100 Power), heals part of the inflicted damage, may burn. Only usable in Mega form.</li></ul><p>This region is deeply connected to <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1918062596189573342' target='_blank'>Latios and Latias</a>, and will develop the story of another couple: <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1919149806078820358' target='_blank'><em>Darek and Eda’s romance</em></a>.</p><p>You'll also encounter the <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1885833097851056411' target='_blank'>Tapus</a> (including a boss fight with <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1881484256729518372' target='_blank'>Tapu Koko</a>), who may have a significant role in the arc. Dr. Vega also plays a part in this region's narrative, plotting to summon <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1945605020763799769' target='_blank'>Deoxys</a> using a massive <a href='https://x.com/PkmnUnbreakTies/status/1862271929224188368' target='_blank'>meteor</a>, supposedly to control it and benefit the Royal Family. The Southern Isles promises to be a tragic and essential turning point.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, only Darek and Eda will be playable here. The protagonist will either remain on the Farm or appear in the Past Arc. There is no timeline confirmation for when these events take place in-game.</p><p>In response to feedback, Ssamurai confirmed on Discord that Darek and Eda’s Pokémon will have full EV spreads to ease gameplay. He also mentioned <a href='https://www.patreon.com/posts/shadow-pokemon-134194300?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link' target='_blank'>Shadow Pokémon</a>, which are expected to appear on the Isles and may be stronger — and possibly catchable?</p><p><strong>The Past Arc</strong> begins from the quest given by Majime at the end of Beta 4, involving a mission to retrieve a rare medicine from the now-destroyed Redwing — obliterated by Rayquaza, under Royal Family influence. (Source: In-game dialogue)</p><p>The time-travel method remains unknown, though fans suspect the Shrine in the Forest of Time may be key. Additionally, a new character was teased by Ssamurai on Discord, showing a figure with green eyes and pinkish-white hair. Later, he <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/ssamurai_98/clip/DarkBashfulTubersNotLikeThis-V6I4Bl7HZyd1zwke' target='_blank'>leaked</a> her name in a stream: Sylphie or Sylphy — spelling still uncertain. She is expected to play a major role in the Past Arc and may be <em>romanceable</em>.</p><p><strong>Future Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Complete redesigns of all characters (to be detailed in a future post)</li><li>Animated sprites in the game menu (menu only)</li><li>Gen 9 move updates and the addition of <strong>Commander</strong>, the ability used by Tatsugiri and Dondozo</li><li>A mystery feature involving a new Point System, previously teased on livestream</li></ul><br><p>Romance content (Social Links) remains endgame-focused, with no current updates</p>"

    "title": "Generation 9 Moves Now in Unbreakable Ties",
    "content": "<p>Recently, <strong>Ssamurai</strong> posted on Twitter about one of the most highly requested features regarding battles in <em>Pokémon Unbreakable Ties</em>: <strong>Generation 9</strong> support.</p><p>Gen 9 brings a wide range of exciting additions, from beloved Pokémon like the powerful Paradox forms and Ogerpon, to already available legendaries like the Swords of Ruin. But what exactly was added — and what’s still missing?</p><p>This post takes a closer look at the new features, what was implemented, and what is planned for the near future.</p><h3>✅ What Was Added?</h3><p>The current update focuses on implementing <strong>moves</strong>. Since Unbreakable Ties runs on <strong>Pokémon Essentials v19.1</strong>, which had no Gen 9 plugin and even issues with Gen 8 moves, the update tackled both at once.</p><p><strong>All Gen 9 moves</strong> (except <em>Tera Blast</em> and <em>Tera Starstorm</em>) have been added, alongside hotfixes for previously bugged Gen 8 moves.</p><p>To make this possible, these specific things were implemented:</p><ul><li><strong>Commander</strong> ability (for <em>Order Up</em>)</li><li>Support for <strong>Ogerpon’s forms and masks</strong> (for <em>Ivy Cudgel</em>)</li><li>Support for <strong>Paldean Tauros</strong> forms (for <em>Raging Bull</em>)</li></ul><p>At this time, the only Gen 9 abilities coded in are: <strong>Sharpness</strong>, <strong>Purifying Salt</strong>, and <strong>Commander</strong>.</p><h3>🛠️ What’s Planned for the Future?</h3><p>The plan is to review all Gen 9 Pokémon and implement existing abilities from previous generations, such as <em>Moxie</em> for Quaquaval.</p><p>While not all Gen 9 abilities will be available in the <em>first</em> release of Beta 5, the following abilities are confirmed to be added:</p><ul><li><strong>Swords of Ruin</strong></li><li><strong>Paradox Pokémon</strong></li><li><strong>Gholdengo</strong></li></ul><p>This should ensure that most Gen 9 Pokémon are covered to some extent.</p><h3>🤔 Why Not Add Full Gen 9 Now?</h3><p>As mentioned, Unbreakable Ties is currently developed on <strong>Essentials v19.1</strong>, which — in simple terms — is pretty rough.</p><p>Do you remember <strong>Route 17</strong>? The rainy one? That’s why. Large, detailed maps on this version cause severe FPS drops, especially since Essentials v19.1 ties its FPS to the total number of animated frames on-screen.</p><p>There is a possibility of eventually moving development to <strong>Essentials v21.1</strong>. This shift would bring:</p><ul><li>Uncapped FPS (based on your monitor)</li><li>Built-in <strong>V-Sync</strong> to prevent screen tearing</li><li>Massive performance improvements</li><li>A completely recoded <strong>AI system</strong> — with smarter switching, better move choice logic, and less randomness</li><li>A new <strong>Ace System</strong>, ensuring enemy Aces appear last in tough fights</li><li>Improved translation tools for multilingual support</li></ul><br><h3>🔄 What Does That Mean for Gen 9?</h3><p>Switching to a newer version would allow using pre-built Gen 9 plugins. However, it would also mean all current Gen 9 coding efforts (done on v19.1) would be <strong>obsolete</strong>.</p><p>Because of this, the update might by aiming on only implementing critical Gen 9 content for now. If the version update happens, full integration would be possible — and worth the wait.</p><p>For now, we’ll have to wait and see what else Beta 5 will bring us!</p>"
